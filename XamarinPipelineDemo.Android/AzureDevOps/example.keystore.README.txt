The accompanying example.keystore file was generated by the automatic process of
Xamarin making a keystore when you do a debug-deploy.  Xamarin.UITest puts a
test package on the target device/emulator; the app and the package have to
be signed by the same key, so if you are testing an app that is already on
the device/emulator, you can specify the keystore that was used.

keystore password: android
key alias: androiddebugkey
key password: android

Read the repo README.md for info on how to use example.keystore in your pipeline.

Reminder: normally, you don't want to put your keystore or keystore-related
passwords in your repo, but this is a demo repo.
